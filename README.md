Abstract
of
WESTERN EPISTEMOLOGIES AND INDIGENOUS SCIENCE WITH A FOCUS ON ETHNIC STUDIES PEDAGOGY IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL SETTING
by
Anselmo Alonzo Marín
Statement of Problem
Trends show an underrepresentation of Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) in STEM and STEM careers. It is necessary that all students with any STEM interest be afforded the opportunity to have these interests nurtured to pursue a STEM career. As BIPOC student populations in K-12 classrooms increase, science education must be tailored for students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.
The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) provide a way to reach BIPOC students, but it is not enough. The NGSS are not a curriculum, so it is up to educators to plan and teach curriculum that is culturally relevant. However, science and science curriculum are heavily influenced by whiteness, colonization, Western epistemologies, and the absence of BIPOC science practices and knowledge. In order for BIPOC students to be interested in STEM careers, their attitude, participation, and interest in these areas must be nurtured by decolonizing science education.

Sources of Data
This research was guided by decolonial methodology and utilized mixed-methods practices that resulted in participants who completed pre and post surveys in addition to a voluntary interview with the researcher to reflect on how a decolonized science unit may have influenced their attitude, participation, and interest in STEM.
Conclusions Reached
The findings from this study reveal that BIPOC participants’ attitude, participation, and interest in STEM were positively influenced by a decolonized science unit. BIPOC participants found connections between their culture and the decolonized curriculum to view STEM as a possible career choice.

from systemic and environmental racism. Systemic racism has been amplified throughout 2020 and 2021 by the killings of George Floyd and Brianna Taylor, the COVID-19 virus and anti-Asian sentiment, and the harmful effects of climate change. Black, Indigenous, Asian, and Latinx Americans have shouldered the greatest burden of these complex issues (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Protests against police brutality, systemic racism of Black Americans (Peeples, 2019), health inequities in underrepresented minority communities, racially motivated Asian American attacks, and environmental injustices have “been dismissed and drowned out by political arguments” (Bharti, 2020, p. 780). Systemic racism also underlies the education system, such as the curriculum and the lack of Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) in science technology (STEM) careers.
The fields of STEM have been historically influential in promoting the systemic racism and injustices that are now prevalent in the twenty-first century. In the late 19th century, Sir Ronald Ross argued “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon the success with the microscope” (The Malaria Expedition to West Africa, 1900, p. 36). Ross’ words imply that science is to be used to argue and morally justify imperialism, empire, and good faith towards colonized people due to the benefits of science on colonial subjects. “Modern Western science is inextricably entangled with colonialism ... and the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today” (Roy,

The twenty-first century has presented increasingly complex problems stemming

2018, p. 1). Moreover, new technologies such as photographs depicting racial stereotypes of colonized people, steamboats and aircraft for exploration, and wireless radio for secret communication were used to expand colonialism (Roy, 2018). STEM has largely operated from a colonizing, white supremacist viewpoint perpetuating a “political and economic domination of the rest of the world” (Roy, 2018, p. 3).
Odekunle (2020) states, “Scientists should consider the many ways that inequality manifests in science, including science’s historical contributions to discrimination, the lack of representation in science, and the extra burden on minority scientists to fix issues relating to diversity and inclusion” (p. 781). As a result, STEM must play a pivotal role in addressing systemic racism, social injustice, and the environmental issues of the twenty- first century by “understanding the scope of systemic inequality in science [to] enable genuine and sustainable efforts to make scientific institutions fair for all” (Odekunle, 2020, p. 781). The systemic racism and injustices can be partially addressed by decolonizing science education and increasing the number of BIPOC in STEM careers. This can be achieved by nurturing the attitudes, participation, and interests of BIPOC students in STEM.
Statement of the Problem
The trends in literature and media report the underrepresentation of BIPOC, especially African Americans and Latinos in STEM and STEM careers. As these careers continue to be available, it is imperative that all students with STEM interests are provided the opportunities to nurture these interests and the opportunities to obtain the necessary education to qualify for these jobs. Moreover, as populations of BIPOC

students in K-12 classrooms increase, science education must be pedagogically representative and tailored to diverse student backgrounds.
The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) provide an avenue to reach BIPOC students, but it is not enough. The NGSS are not a curriculum, so it is up to teachers to creatively plan and teach curriculum that is culturally relevant. One challenge is that traditional curriculum typically does not include BIPOC in science, is steeped in whiteness, and is colonizing. Another contributing factor of exclusion of BIPOC in STEM is due to Western epistemologies in science and the absence of science practices from BIPOC populations that recognize their science history and knowledge. In order to increase BIPOC populations in STEM careers, students’ attitude, participation, and interest in these areas need to be nurtured. This research addresses the racism of Western epistemologies in science curriculum and the lack of cultural science practices from BIPOC populations by decolonizing science education in order to promote the attitude, participation, and interest of BIPOC groups in STEM and STEM careers.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study is to examine the influence between a middle school decolonized science unit that incorporated Indigenous science on the attitudes, participation, and interests of BIPOC students in STEM. The study will measure participants’ pre and post attitude, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers for the whole group and by subgroups. The subgroups include female, male, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and White. The research will reflect on how

The insight gained from this study can be used to redesign science curriculum and lesson plans, offer recommendations to current and pre-service science teachers,
advance Ethnic Studies pedagogies in the field of science, and help address how schools with high BIPOC populations can promote student interests in STEM careers. The study is unique in that it attempts to approach science education from a decolonial framework and practice. The study addresses the following research question: How did a unit focused on decolonized science influence the attitudes, participation, interests of BIPOC middle school science students in STEM and STEM careers?
Delimitations & Assumptions
The delimitations of this study by the researcher will be the grade levels (middle school, 6th, and 8th grade), the specific NGSS standards and content, the Ethnic Studies pedagogies, the school setting, and the number of lessons in the unit. The assumptions for this study includes that students will want to be part of this study. Additionally, it is assumed that BIPOC students will lack attitude, participation, or interest in STEM and STEM careers because other subjects may be deemed easier, or they have been colonized to believe it is not for them. It is assumed that there is a way to positively influence the attitudes, participation, and interest of BIPOC students in STEM and STEM careers through the implementation of a series of decolonized science lessons that are more representative of their backgrounds and cultures.
BIPOC students feel about their connection to science, their ability to use science to address community issues, and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Significance of the Study
      
Definition of Terms
 Achievement gap: Any significant and persistent disparity in academic
performance or educational attainment between different groups of students, such as White and Black students, White and Hispanic or Latino students and recent immigrant and White students (Ladson-Billings, 2006).
 Attitude: A feeling or emotion to a fact or state. How a concept is perceived or reacted upon.
 BIPOC: Black Indigenous Person of Color is a term used to identify or group underrepresented races or ethnicities.
 Colonialism: The combination of territorial, juridical, cultural, linguistic, political, mental/epistemic, and/or economic domination of one group of people or groups of people by another (external) group of people (Murrey, 2020).
 Colonial matrix of power: The structures and institutions of power, control and hegemony that emerged with the modern world of colonialism starting in 1492 and are still at large. The concept was organized by Quijano (2000) to represent the geographical, political, and onto-epistemological extension of western domination, through four interrelated domains: economy, authority, gender/sexuality and knowledge.
 Decolonial: “Responses to the making, transformations, and persistence of coloniality” (Mignolo, 2011, p. 40).

 Decolonial epistemologies: Emerges from the undermining and eroding of the colonial matrix of power. Decolonizing knowledge towards liberation from sacred knowledge. Living in harmony and reciprocity.
 Decolonizing epistemology: Means to “decolonize naturalized principles on which knowledge is built, in disciplinary formations as well as in ideological discourses in the public sphere” (Mignolo, 2011, p. 22). This includes “Liberating thinking from sacralized texts, whether religious or secular” (Mignolo, 2011, p. 26).
 Decolonial thinking: Refers to “delinking from Eurocentrism. Confronts the entire colonial matrix of power” (Mignolo, 2011, p. 39). Means to “dwell and think in the border, and changing from within” (Mignolo, 2011, p. 26)
 Decoloniality: “A decolonial epistemology that questions the nature of the world economy, capitalism, (Mignolo, 2011, p. 37)
 Decolonization: “Native Hawai’ian nationalist and political scientist Haunani Kay-Trask (1999) defines decolonization as, ‘collective resistance to colonialism, including cultural assertions, [and] efforts towards self-determination’ (251)” (Camangian & Cariaga, 2021, p. 13). This starts by decolonizing knowledge (Mignolo, 2011, p. 32).
 Decolonized science: Decolonized science comes from the process of decolonizing Western epistemologies in science through decolonization and decolonial epistemologies. The use of Indigenous science helps achieve

 STEM: An acronym that groups the subjects Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics, yet specific careers under the STEM umbrella can be debated. Some researchers narrow the definition down specifically to professional or technical support positions within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; whereas other researchers include educators, healthcare professionals, and social scientists under the STEM heading (USDC, 2011a; USDC, 2011b). Despite disagreement regarding the exact definition of STEM, researchers tend to emphasize the importance of promoting the education, training, and interest in these subject areas for adolescents.

Introduction
Chapter 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter frames the research study through a decolonial analysis of systemic racism in science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM). From the analysis, I am calling for a decolonized science curriculum that counters Eurocentric content, values and ideologies and shows students “how autonomous, resourceful, and abundant their civilizations were prior to their relationship to colonialism” (Camangian & Cariaga, 2021, p. 3). Until there is a change in the type of science being taught, students who are Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) students will continue to be disengaged in science and will not want to pursue STEM careers. Consequently, if students do not know about their culture’s historical contributions and representation in STEM then it “becomes difficult for them to imagine something radically different than the material conditions they currently find themselves in” (Camangian & Cariaga, 2021, p. 3). Additionally, the STEM field must increase in BIPOC population in order to also provide different perspectives.
Diversifying the STEM Field
Within the next forty years, the population of the United States is expected to experience unprecedented demographic shifts. An analysis from the U.S. Census Bureau (2012) indicates the United States will become a majority-minority nation by 2043 in addition to reaching majority-minority status for children by 2019 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013). Although women have made strides in STEM careers, a Pew Research Center

10
analysis (2018) of U.S. Census Bureau data since 1990 states that “while jobs in STEM have grown substantially, particularly in computer occupations, the share of women working in STEM jobs has remained at about half over time” (p. 7). While women make up half the STEM workforce, the Pew Research Center (2018) shares that “Women are a majority of those working in health-related occupations but just 14%, on average, of those in engineering jobs” (p. 7). The Pew Research Center (2018) also notes, “Blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in STEM occupations relative to their share in the U.S. workforce” (p. 8). Hispanics represent 16% of the workforce but only account for 7% of those in STEM (Pew Research Center, 2018). Asians are overrepresented in the STEM workforce, relative to their overall share of the workforce, especially among college-educated workers: 17% of college-educated STEM workers are Asian, while only 10% of all workers with a college degree are Asian.
Odekunle (2020) reminds us that the lack of diversity in scientific institutions contributes to ongoing systemic racism and offers several actions to address the inequality and ensure “all scientists of all backgrounds can help create a more inclusive, diverse, and fair community” (p. 781). These actions include hiring and retention practices, anti-racist workplace policies, providing BIPOC professionals with career mentorship, and recognizing the works of diverse individuals. Although these approaches are a step towards ensuring BIPOC are hired and retained in STEM careers, they center on the scientific community and do not address how to increase the number of BIPOC students who can become professionals in these careers.

11
In 2010, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) called for increased numbers of students of color to pursue STEM careers (Basile & Lopez, 2015). The report cited an economic benefit, a diverse perspective as a benefit to STEM from many previous STEM policy reports but highlighted the STEM experience for all to enjoy and “benefit from the knowledge and skills, especially groups that have been traditionally excluded” (p. 544). The council provided these perspectives without recommendations on how to help increase the number of students of color to pursue STEM careers. A consensus amongst women and BIPOC in STEM careers emphasized quality schooling, early encouragement, and continuous support as ways to attract more people like themselves into STEM careers (Pew Research Center, 2018). In order for students to become interested in STEM careers, they need to see themselves in the curriculum and these careers.
The underrepresentation of BIPOC in STEM careers has been an ongoing concern for the last four decades (Pew Research Center, 2018). When Americans were asked about the lack of diversity in STEM careers, many attributed this to “a lack of encouragement for girls and blacks and Hispanics to pursue STEM from an early age” (Pew Research Center, 2018, p. 21). Science achievement gaps exist for students of color and begin in elementary school and widen throughout high school (Newkirk, 2016). The term achievement gap places the blame on students for their performance when in fact an opportunity gap exists that has led to BIPOC students’ lower achievement and contributed to keeping them out of STEM careers. This can be explained by what Ladson-Billings (2006, 2013) refers to as the education debt. The “education debt is

12
composed of historical, economic, sociopolitical, and moral components” (Castagno & Project Muse, 2014, p. 7) and therefore denies students of color and socioeconomically disadvantaged students opportunities to learn. The denial of learning opportunities is often rooted in a historically white, racist, and oppressive education system and “requires a more holistic, historic, and comprehensive analysis of schooling than that implied by the focus on achievement gaps” (Castagno & Project Muse, 2014, p. 7).
“A growing evidence base demonstrates that students across economic, social, and other demographic groupings can and do learn science when provided appropriate opportunities'' (NRC, 2012, p. 298). The term opportunity gap places a responsibility on teachers and society to ensure BIPOC students are not excluded from STEM. The underrepresentation of BIPOC students in the STEM disciplines “requires educators’ attention to provide students from all cultural backgrounds with appropriate opportunities to learn” (Ghattas & Carver, 2017, p. 23). Lee (2003) posits that learning can be enhanced when it occurs in contexts that are meaningful and relevant to students’ lives. The opportunity gap is created and reinforced by whiteness, mainstream Westernized science education practices, and curriculum that is accepted by society and used by teachers. Castagno and Project Muse (2014) state:
Whiteness refers to structural arrangements and ideologies of race dominance. Racial power and inequities are at the core of whiteness. Whiteness maintains power and privilege by perpetuating and legitimizing the status quo while simultaneously maintaining a veneer of neutrality, equality, and compassion (p. 5).

13
Today in the United States, “culturally diverse students’ experiences are not in harmony with the dominant culture or with the science discipline in Western culture” (Ghattas & Carver, 2017, p. 22). Students in developing countries and industrialized countries (like the United States) feel that school science is like a foreign culture to them (Maddock, 1981; Aikenhead, 1996; Costa, 1995) “that clashes with the system of their native cultural beliefs, history, and values” (Ghattas & Carver, 2017, p. 22). Aikenhead and Elliot (2010) remind us that “School science usually attempts to enculturate all students into the culture of academic Eurocentric science, replete with its canonical knowledge, techniques, and values” (p. 5). Since white ideologies, Modern Western science, colonial science, and curriculum do not reflect BIPOC students’ lives and experiences, it can contribute to the lack of BIPOC students’ participation and interest in STEM. A majority of students end up feeling alienated simply by the foreign language of science (Brown & Spang, 2008).
The Origins of Modern Western Science
There is often a misconception of Westernized thought that Modern western science emerged during the Renaissance. People used to think that modern Western science “was born nearly half a millennium ago at the time of the Renaissance in Europe” (Iaccarino, 2003, p. 220). The Renaissance is a period of science and culture rebirth between the fifteenth century and seventeenth century. However, during that time period, the accumulated science knowledge from Greek/Islamic science in Europe was transformed into the modern science we know today. Iaccarino (2003) further explains the origins of modern Western science prior to the Renaissance:

14
...the foundations of modern science were laid long before this time, and were particularly influenced by Islamic civilization. The Muslims were the leading scholars between the seventh and fifteenth centuries, and were the heirs of the scientific traditions of Greece, India, and Persia. After appropriation and assimilation, they built on these discoveries, and developed a truly Islamic science that led worldwide knowledge in all scientific fields (p. 220).
The Renaissance and scientific revolution in Europe was made possible by the transfer of knowledge of Islamic science to the West. Basalla (1967) writes “A small circle of Western European nations provided the original home for modern science during the 16th and 17th centuries: Italy, France, England, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and the Scandinavian countries” (p. 611). Elshakry (2010) shares, “Early references to “Western science” in English suggest that prior to the nineteenth century the term was used primarily to refer to ancient Greek science” (p. 100). It is important for the reader to remember that the Muslims were the heirs of the scientific traditions of Greece and therefore ancient Greek science. Elshakry (2010) further shares, “Beginning in the eighteenth century it [Western science] was sometimes used interchangeably with “European science”” (p. 100). Elshakry (2010) explains the view of science in Europe:
In the nineteenth century an entirely new global discourse around the idea of science emerged. As in Europe itself at this time, this new conception was plagued by a conflation of the view of science as a body of techniques, on the one hand, and as a natural philosophy, on the other (p. 100).

15
The appeal of science as a body of techniques was legitimized and “brought it in line with older traditions of knowledge and belief around the world” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 100). The techniques used for the expansion of Western power through European military and technological supremacy led to “evidence of the efficacy of the “European sciences”” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 100). The bridging of the new conceptions of Western (European) science with older forms of knowledge from now colonized regions around the world transformed local “traditions of knowledge and learning”” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 100). The case can be made that the transformation of local knowledge and learning through Western learning resulted in colonial science.
Modern Western Science and Colonial Science
The expansion of Western-style schools and academies including “mission colleges, polytechnics, naval and military academies, and arsenals” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 101) in regions like Egypt and China focused on the needs of the state instead of local communities. In the early nineteenth century, the Ottoman state in Egypt underwent bureaucratic reform and rapid militarization through the schools and subjects being taught “by instructors, technical experts, or military officers from France, Italy, and England” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 101). The pupils of these instructors received science instruction through a European lens lacking focus on local knowledge and cultural traditions. By the end of the 19th century in Egypt, “a new generation of intellectuals was ready to champion the introduction of science on entirely new terms” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 101). China experienced a similar transformation of learning and intellectuals due to Western intervention.

16
The Opium War of 1849-1852 led to the interest of Western science as useful knowledge and eventually “transformed the intellectual and institutional nexus of traditional learning” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 102). Additionally, British and American Protestant missionaries in China enlisted science in their proselytizing efforts and were some of the first to refer to the term Western science. The new science in China was designated under Western learning and at first reinforced traditions and disciplines of knowledge (Elshakry, 2010). However, as missionaries taught and connected Chinese and Western science, they played a key role in the translation of science terms, promoted a specific vision of science, and “helped to transmit what they counted as Western science” (Elshakry, 2010, p. 103).
As regions across the globe were physically colonized by Europeans so were the cultures, minds, and sciences of the regions to create colonial science. As mentioned earlier by Roy (2018), “Modern Western science is inextricably entangled with colonialism ... and the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today” (p. 1). Colonial science is a form of modern Western science as it is used through the lens and culture of Western colonialism rather than the local traditional knowledge and learning. Basalla (1967) defines colonial science as “dependent science” where “the scientific activity in the new land is based primarily upon institutions and traditions of a nation with an established scientific culture. The dependent country may or may not be a colony of a European nation” (p. 613). Although the United States was not under European rule like Egypt, China, and India much of the science and knowledge used by the settlers and the framers came from European thought and institutions. Basalla (1967) points out that

17
Colonial science erodes and destroys traditional knowledge and replaces it with Western educational and cultural systems (Mazzocchi, 2006) that include modern Western science. In India from the 19th to the early 20th century, “Indian scientists, surveyors, and engineers disparaged the backwardness and superstition of “traditional” Indian learning, indigenous epistemologies and techniques, and the colonized populace as a whole” (Adas, 1997, p. 481). Eventually, Indian scientists “geared procedures and technical and scientific findings to Western audiences; and scrambled for the approval and honors that could be bestowed by their British superiors or scientific and technical societies in the metropolis” (Adas, 1997, p. 481). “In a review of Technology and the Raj (MacLeod & Kumar, 1995) Adas (1997) reminds us that Ambirajan and Kumar call attention to “scientific transfers under colonialism: the fundamental shifts in organization, technique, and epistemologies that resulted from the introduction of Western education” (p. 481). The Western epistemologies that are reinforced through colonial science help create cultural dissonance and irreparable long term effects to the cultural identity and local traditional knowledge of those now within the Western culture and educational system. It is plausible that the evolution of science epistemologies in Egypt, China, and India was mirrored anywhere European colonialism was present, including the Americas.
colonial science “can occur in situations where there is no actual colonial relationship” (p. 613).

Modern Western Science and Colonizing Curriculum
Western science as defined by Mazzocchi (2006) employs analytical and reductionist methods, is positivist, objective, quantitative, and is based on academic and literate transmission while isolating objects of study from context into simplified and controllable experimental environments. It is also based on maximizing production and the exploitation of resources (Mazzocchi, 2006). Missing from Western science is any relationship with culture and identity or local traditional knowledge. The Western epistemologies found in Western science that removed these aspects from those being colonized in the past are present today in our educational system and science curriculums. What we have in science classrooms today are colonized science curriculums that students are continuously exposed to and internalized. Epistemologies are the underlying theories, beliefs, and methods of knowledge found in all areas of study including the sciences. These epistemologies have evolved throughout history, leading to science curriculums that are dominated by Westernized philosophies and ideologies. Current modern Western science and epistemologies evolved from Greek/Islamic science and the Renaissance, then changed again through colonization.
The science being taught to students in the United States is not only Westernized and colonized but is also mired in whiteness due to the dominant (white) culture it is being practiced in. Whiteness is a problem in science curriculums where the achievements of white men are typically recognized and those of BIPOC are non- existent. Picower (2021) reminds us that “teachers create curriculum that flows from their ideology” (p. 13) so they teach what they believe. According to Taie and Goldring
18

19
(2020), “79 percent of all public school teachers are non-Hispanic White” (p. 3) in the United States. This leads to what Nojan (2020) describes as, “The privileging of Eurocentric content, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) values and ideologies [that] has become normative fabric of the U.S. educational system contributing to the historical and structural inequities that shape schooling” (p. 26) and curriculums. Science curriculums have historically incorporated Western science, colonial science, Western epistemologies, and are steeped in whiteness leaving BIPOC students disconnected to science. Educational reforms have attempted to address issues of inequity and underrepresentation of BIPOC students in STEM by adopting new standards in mathematics and science but continue to fall short.
Next Generation Science Standards
In 2013, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) were officially released and posted for adoption in the United States. The National Research Council (2012) developed a Framework for K-12 science education, which set standards for what it means to be proficient in science and presents three dimensions: science and engineering practices (SEP), disciplinary core ideas (DCI), and crosscutting concepts (CCC). There are eight SEPs that provide students the opportunities to do the work of scientists and engineers. The work ranges from asking questions and defining problems to analyzing and interpreting data to engaging in argument from evidence. The DCIs are the specific science content and topics students engage in. They are divided into four disciplines: Physical Science, Life Science, Earth & Space Science, and Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science and are integrated within the student performance

expectations. It should be noted that the DCIs are designed to spiral each year so that students are exposed to all of them across their K-12 education. The CCCs “have applications across all aspects of science” (NGSS, 2013, p. xv) and link the different disciplines found in the DCIs. There are seven CCCs that range from Patterns to Cause and Effect, to Systems and System Models to Stability and Change and help students make connections across all science subjects.
Compared to old versions of science standards, the NGSS reflect several conceptual shifts including an alignment to Common Core State Standards in Mathematics and Language Arts and are interconnected across K-12 science education that intertwines content knowledge, inquiry practices, and engineering design. The NGSS emphasizes standards as student performance expectations, and are not curriculum (NRC, 2012). Although these new standards are designed to help address the critical issues of United States competitiveness and to better prepare the workforce (NRC, 2012), the standards give local educators the flexibility to design classroom learning experiences that stimulate students’ interests in science and prepares them for college, careers, and citizenship. While the goal of NGSS as described in the framework (NRC, 2012) is to prepare students for citizenship, the term citizenship can be problematic. U.S. classrooms have undocumented students, and they also deserve the right to science education, regardless of their status.
One example of a middle school NGSS performance expectation is the following: MS-ESS3-3. Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment. This standard is designed to integrate the
20
      
21
three dimensions of NGSS by having students Construct Explanations and Design Solutions (SEP), while they address Human Impact on Earth’s Systems (DCI) and make connections across science disciplines by examining Stability and Change (CCC), Cause and Effect (CCC), and the Influence of Science, Engineering, and Technology on Society and the Natural World (CCC). Amplify Science is a state-wide approved middle school science curriculum that includes two consecutive units where this performance expectation is found (The Lawrence Hall of Science, n.d.). Table 1 below provides an overview of Amplify's four chapter unit titled Earth’s Changing Climate: Vanishing Ice. Table 1

Constructing Explanations & Designing Solutions
Students learn to distinguish between trends and fluctuations in data. Students also use a digital model to gather evidence.
Students gather evidence from a digital model and a simple physical model and obtain information from a video and an article. Students also construct visual models.
Students obtain information from an article and gather evidence from a digital model. Students also construct written explanations.
Students analyze data to make oral and written arguments about whether a large volcanic eruption causes Earth’s temperature to become warmer or cooler.
 
           Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI)
Human Impacts on Earth’s Systems
Students gather evidence about how various changes to the atmosphere affect Earth’s temperature.
Students use visual models to explain the effects of carbon dioxide and methane to the Earth’s atmosphere.
Students determine how human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, keeping livestock, and deforestation cause methane and carbon dioxide to increase in the atmosphere. Students explain strategies humans can use to decrease the amount of these gases.
Students use data and models to describe human activities and population and their effect on carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere.
22
Students apply their learning about gases in the atmosphere, human activity, and Earth’s climate.
           Cross Cutting Concepts (CCC)
Stability and Change
Cause & Effect
Students use evidence to determine the stability or change in Earth’s global average temperature and ice cover.
Students use visual models to explain how the addition of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere disrupts a dynamic but stable system and causes climate change.
Students make and evaluate arguments based on how a large volcanic eruption affects Earth’s atmosphere and causes global temperature to change or remain stable.
     The unit guides students towards constructing explanations and evaluating climate change solutions, which is a good goal for science education. However, the ideologies of the curriculum are Westernized and lack opportunities for students to engage with their own culture, identity, or reflect on how the content affects them personally in their communities. While this unit addresses human impact on the Earth, it does not, as

23
In the following unit, titled Earth’s Changing Climate Engineering Internship: Rooftops for Sustainable Cities, the focus is on the Crosscutting Concept- Influence of Science, Engineering, and Technology on Society and the Natural World, where students design a climate change solution. Playing the role of civil engineering interns, they learn about The Design Cycle (plan, build, test, analyze) and apply their understanding of energy and climate science to create roof modification designs for a city in the desert. Students consider two roof types, white and solar, and design a proposal of roof modifications the city could implement to reduce the city’s climate impact. The design project asks students to consider three criteria: reducing climate impact, preserving the city’s historical character, and keeping costs low. Students use the RoofMod Design Tool (simulation) to collect and analyze data, complete iterative tests, and learn about isolating variables. By the end of this unit, students can describe engineering practices and compose a written proposal that supports their optimal design for making the city more environmentally responsible, while managing the trade-offs of each of the project criteria. While the activities in the curriculum guide students to develop a plan to help mitigate climate change, the activities are based in Eurocentric knowledge, are analytical, and are isolated from context with no cultural relevance to students and their own communities. Moreover, they do not provide students the opportunity to solve real world problems in their own community and are limited by the simplistic and controlled environments of

Westernized science. There is no authenticity or translation of what students learn into their community and students are not asked to create real change. When curriculum like this is presented through a lens of whiteness, where Eurocentric knowledge is embedded and reinforces colonial ideologies, BIPOC students are omitted, marginalized, and left disconnected from science.
Critical Analysis of NGSS
There are two main problems with the NGSS: (1) the standards are based on westernized epistemologies and (2) state adopted curriculums aligned to these standards do not meet the needs of all students, particularly related to engaging BIPOC students in science. The three dimensions of the NGSS, while well intentioned, may diminish students’ interest in science or STEM. The vision of NGSS (2013), as outlined by “All Standards, All Students” is to make science accessible for all students, especially BIPOC students; however, this vision of equitable science education cannot be done automatically. The NGSS (2013) “do not dictate the manner or methods by which the standards are taught” (p. xiv). As such, the vision of NGSS (2013) must be enacted by each teacher through their critical planning and instruction, tailored to their specific students, so that the science is authentic and meaningful for students. The vision must also be enacted by publishers and curriculum designers; however, this is problematic. Most teachers, publishers, and curriculum designers are part of the colonized society that accepts Western epistemologies and whiteness of curriculum thereby reinforcing an oppressive education system that leads to BIPOC students not seeing STEM as relevant to them.
                
25
The inclusion of the new engineering components in the science standards helps NGSS rebuke Science for All Americans (1989) by “reinterpret[ing] a traditional view of epistemology and history of science” (NGSS, 2013, p. 390) which defined science in terms of Western science while ignoring historical contributions from other cultures and presented a limited or distorted view of science. The attempt by the NGSS to integrate historical contributions of other cultures into science through the engineering components in order to “redefine the epistemology of science or what counts as science, which, in turn, defines or determines school science curriculum” (NGSS, 2013, p. 392) is not sufficient. The NGSS does not go far enough to ensure all students, especially BIPOC students, and their cultures are represented beyond the engineering components so students feel they can be in STEM careers. While solving problems through engineering as outlined in All Standards for All Students is to “have the potential to be inclusive of students who have been traditionally marginalized in the science classroom and do not see science as relevant to their lives or future” (Achieve Inc., 2013, p. 4) there is no research to show how engineering can achieve this. Rodriguez (2015) argues a need to know how “the systematic implementation of engineering practices improves traditionally marginalized students' engagement and performance in science” (p. 1036). The westernization of the NGSS excludes other cultures from the curriculum and the activities used to meet the goals of NGSS.
While there is a concerted effort by the NGSS to address equity and diversity in Chapter 11 of the Framework, and how to “enact effective science teaching in diverse contexts in the NGSS Case Studies'' (Rodriguez, 2015, p. 1041), there is a contradictory
                      
26
message sent by the NGSS that is interpreted by publishers and curriculum developers. Equity and diversity are not embedded throughout the standards themselves and are relegated as an “add-on” to the NGSS and aptly named as an appendix instead of being given the proper focus and attention as the DCIs, CCCs, or SEPs. So the task of ensuring all students, especially BIPOC, are included in the curriculum so they can see themselves in STEM ultimately rests on teachers. Current science curriculums purport to be NGSS aligned, but when publishers take their direction from the NGSS, BIPOC students and their cultures are typically not included in these curriculums. In 2019, EdReports conducted the first independent review of six new science middle school curriculums for grades 6-8 to determine if they are truly aligned to the NGSS. EdReports is a “non-profit that tries to gauge whether published learning materials align to states’ expectations for students, including the NGSS and the Common Core State Standards and relies on teachers to use an in-house framework to judge each curriculum” (Sawchuk, 2019, p. 1). Four curriculums, Discovery’s Science Techbook, Carolina’s Biological Supply Company’s Science and two from Teachers’ Curriculum Institute Bring Science Alive! were rated insufficiently aligned to the NGSS. One curriculum from Houghton Mifflin Hartcourt’s Science Dimensions, was considered partially aligned; however, Amplify’s Amplify Science, received top marks for alignment, coherence, and usability. The framework used by teachers “focus on how well they [curriculums] embody key features of the NGSS, the specific coherence of lessons, and their usability for teachers” (Sawchuk, 2019, p. 3). While Amplify Science is reported to be well-aligned with the NGSS and provides ample activities in which the goals of the NGSS can be met, it still
                      
27
does not address the intersectionalities of BIPOC students or serve the purpose of social and racial justice.
An example of a middle school NGSS performance standard in Amplify Science is MS-ESS3-3. Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment. Students conduct several activities in the curriculum to achieve the goals set by the NGSS. They collect and analyze climate data from simulations, create arguments based on evidence from the data or articles, participate in a seminar debating how to best mitigate climate change, and design a climate change solution. While the activities help meet the goals of the NGSS, they are Westernized and do not incorporate the vision of “All Standards, All Students.” The activities are also Eurocentric and mired in whiteness leaving out representation of BIPOC knowledge and cultural relevance to BIPOC students. As such, the NGSS will not meet its well-intended goals unless there is more prompt and direct transformative action. A structural response and new curricular approaches are needed.
Transforming Science Curriculum
The case can be made for socially transformative science education and curriculum that is decolonized, representative of BIPOC knowledge and experience, and is culturally relevant to BIPOC students. Berta-Ávila (2004) points out that “when popular “scripted” curricula dismiss or diminish the lived experiences of students it becomes the responsibility of the educator to integrate and place the realities of the student at the forefront” (p. 74). Camangian and Cariaga (2021) argue:
         
28
Wherever oppression exists, it is often met with transformational resistance (Solórzano & Delgado-Bernal, 2001) and problem-posing praxis (Freire [1970], 2000), all of which are inspired by people’s community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005) and should be the basis upon which teachers build their classroom practices from (p. 3).
Science education as a vehicle for social change is not new. Roth and Désautels (2002) present several ways in which science education curriculum can be used to promote social change. Mutegi (2011) posits that African American students “would greatly benefit from a socially transformative approach to science education curricula designed to help them meet their unique sociohistorical needs” (p. 301). Until there is a change in the type of science being taught, BIPOC students will continue to be disengaged in science and will not want to pursue STEM careers.
Indigenous Science and Decolonized Science
Indigenous science and the decolonization of science are ways in which educators can use science to further achieve the goals of cultural relevance, social justice, and social transformation. Indigenous science is “an ancient and dynamic body of knowledge embedded in sophisticated cultural epistemologies that has long been marginalized by the institutions of contemporary Western science” (College of Environmental Science and Forestry, 2017). Furthermore, it is based on conservation, traditional knowledge and local ecological knowledge of plants, land, and animals. Additionally, Snively and Corsiglia (2000) state,
               
29
Indigenous science interprets how the local world works through a particular cultural perspective and includes the knowledge of both indigenous expansionist cultures (e.g., the Aztec, Mayan, and Mongolian Empires) as well as the home based knowledge of long-term resident oral resident peoples (i.e., the Inuit, the Aboriginal people of Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, Europe, Micronesia, and New Zealand) (p. 10).
Indigenous science can be achieved through decolonized science where Indigenous knowledge that has been disparaged by Western science for centuries is reclaimed. Decolonized science comes from the process of decolonizing Western epistemologies in science through decolonization and decolonial epistemologies. Mignolo (2011) states that “Decolonizing epistemology means to decolonize naturalized principles on which knowledge is built, in disciplinary formations as well as in ideological discourses in the public sphere” (p. 22). He defines decolonizing citing Anibal Quijano “decolonizing means to disengage (de-link) from eurocentrism, controlled by Western languages and institutions, since the Renaissance, grounded in Greek and Latin as the ultimate linguistic ground in which epistemic categories are lodged” (p. 23). Decolonization is also central to the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum through value and principle number three: “Center and place high value on pre-colonial, ancestral, indigenous, diasporic, familial, and marginalized knowledge” (LESMC, 2020, para. 7).
The value of decolonized science with students is demonstrated through several studies. Aikenhead and Elliot (2010), describe a decolonized science curriculum as cross- cultural school science where “Indigenous students learn to master and utilize
             
30
Eurocentric science and technology without, in the process, sacrificing their own cultural ways of knowing nature” (p. 9). A review of research concerning cross-cultural school science in the United States concluded:
Efforts at culturally responsive schooling for Indigenous youth result in students who have enhanced self-esteem, develop healthy [cultural identities], are more self-directed and politically active, give more respect to tribal elders, have a positive influence in their tribal communities, exhibit more positive classroom behaviour and engagement, and achieve academically at higher rates (Brayboy & Castagno, 2008, p. 733).
Additionally, Barnhart, Kawagley, and Hill (2000) describe that cross-cultural school science in Alaska, resulted in Indigenous students’ standardized science test scores uniformly improving over four years to meet national averages. A five-year study with 366 public schools in British Columbia found that Indigenous students increased their achievement when Indigenous content was incorporated into the curriculum (Richards, Hove, & Afolabi, 2008). Lastly, Indigenous student interest and achievement in school science increased whenever African communities collaborated with science educators to create a locally produced cross cultural school science (Jegede & Okebukola, 1991; Lubben & Campbell, 1996). Although these studies are focused on Indigenous students, decolonized science and/or Indigenous science positively influenced students.
The researcher developed a decolonized science unit that incorporated Indigenous science using the LESMC lesson template in order to positively influence students in STEM and STEM careers. Mignolo (2011) states that “The first task of decolonizing
                      
31
Lesson 1 of the unit draws out students’ ideas of what they think science is and who they think a scientist is. The remainder of the lesson has students conducting research on a BIPOC scientist of their choice. This addresses the students’ misconceptions of who scientists are then rebuilds their ideas of who scientists are through their research. Additionally, Lessons 2 and 3 continue to draw out students’ ideas of what they think science is and who they think scientists are. Lesson 2 presents students with Indigenous science and Mesoamerican (Aztec) contributions to STEM in order to continue rebuilding their ideas of what science is and who scientists are. Lesson 3 presents students with Indigenous fire science practices used by Native American tribes to further rebuild their ideas of what science is and who scientists are. In Lesson 3 students also reflect on how their thinking of science and scientists have changed throughout the unit. This learning to unlearn and relearning to rebuild is part of the decolonized approach with Indigenous science content.
Lessons 2 and 3 center and value Indigenous peoples and their contributions in STEM which addresses Tuck and Yang’s (2012) critique of calls to decolonize schools, use decolonizing methods, or decolonize student thinking. They state, “we have observed a startling number of these discussions make no mention of Indigenous people, our/their struggles for the recognition of our/their sovereignty, or the contributions of Indigenous intellectuals and activists to theories and frameworks of decolonization” (pp. 2-3). In the decolonized science unit, Indigenous science is the content being taught. Lesson 2 focuses on Indigenous (Mesoamerican) contributions to STEM and Lesson 3 presents
epistemology consists in learning to unlearn in order to relearn and to rebuild” (p. 26).
                     
Native Americans and their expertise in cultural burns and forest management. The researcher further details the decolonized science unit and lessons in Chapter 3.

decolonized science unit that incorporated Indigenous science on the attitudes, participation, and interests of Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) students in pursuing a science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) career. The researcher collected qualitative and quantitative data to reflect how BIPOC students felt about their connection to science, their ability to use science to address community issues, and their interest in STEM careers. The driving question that guided this study was: How did a unit focused on decolonized science impact students’ attitudes, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers?
The methodology chapter details the mixed methods research design of this study. The researcher describes the procedures for curriculum design and the research instruments that were developed. The chapter also describes the middle school setting as well as information about the middle schoolers who participated in the research study. To conclude the chapter, the researcher outlines how the data was analyzed to examine the driving question that guided the study: How did a unit focused on decolonized science impact BIPOC students’ attitudes, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers?
Study Design
The mixed methods study was designed to address the BIPOC population gap that exists in STEM careers in the United States. A mixed methods study is described as an
Chapter 3
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The intent of this study was to examine the influence between a middle school
  
34
explanatory sequential design where the quantitative data is collected first then the qualitative data is collected after the intervention and used to provide further validation of the quantitative results (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). The researcher collected survey and interview data to determine if the intervention influenced students’ attitudes, participation, and interest to pursue a STEM career. The use of a mixed-methods design allowed for quantitative data about participants’ attitude, participation, and interest in STEM, while also incorporating qualitative data based on the participants same three areas. Patterns from the qualitative data could be used (or not) to support the quantitative results. Creswell and Creswell (2018) stated “more insight into a problem is to be gained from mixing or integration of quantitative and qualitative data” (p. 213).
The design of the study was informed by the lesson plan format used for the three lessons in the decolonized science unit. The lesson plan format came from the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (LESMC, 2020) which is trying to decolonize education and shift the way curriculum is decolonial. The LESMC has two guiding principles and values that aid in decolonial unit and lesson planning: celebrate and center. These, and all the LESMC guiding principles and values are discussed in full detail later in this chapter. Decolonial thinkers such as Tuck and Yang (2011) also informed this study design.
Tuck and Yang advocated to “position the work of Indigenous thinkers as central in unlocking the confounding aspects of public schooling” (p. 3). The decolonized science unit developed by the researcher centered on Indigenous science, Indigenous contributions in STEM, and Indigenous fire burning practices to ensure Indigeneity did
                      
35
not remain invisible and that decolonization did not become a metaphor. Tuck and Yang also discussed that “when metaphor invades decolonization, it kills the very possibility of decolonization” (p. 3).
Research Setting
The study was conducted in a middle school setting. The researcher teaches at a middle school in Northern California and was granted permission by the California State University, Sacramento Institutional Review Board (IRB) Human Subject Research, and the school administrator to conduct the investigation with middle school students as participants. The population for this study is 6th and 8th grade middle school science students at a Northern California Kindergarten through 8th grade Title 1 public school. Ninety percent of the students at the school are Native Spanish speakers who are representative of the two grade levels taught by the researcher. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the study was conducted via the Google Suite using a combination of Google Meets, Google Docs, and Google Slides for lesson activities.
Procedures for Data Collection and Participants
To begin the process of data collection, an overview of the goals and study procedures was provided to 90 6th and 8th grade students in a letter of assent (see Appendix A) and their parents or guardians in a letter of consent (see Appendix B). The letters were translated into Spanish due to a large number of Native Spanish-speaking families. The assent letter asked for students to participate in one pre and one post survey and the option for a one-on-one interview. The information was also on the parent or guardian consent form. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the letter of assent and consent
   
36
was distributed to parents or guardians and students during a school materials pick up day, emailed to parents or guardians and students as a Google Form, and mailed home as a hard copy. These steps were necessary to provide multiple recruiting methods due to COVID-19 restrictions. Parents/guardians and students received a deadline of seven days from the school materials pick-up day to return the letters to the school office or submit the Google Form. All returned consent and assent letters and Google Form data were tallied and rostered for participants at the end of the seven-day return deadline. Of the ninety middle school students taught by the researcher, 51 students provided assent and their parents or guardian provided consent to participate in the survey, and only 13 students provided consent for the interview. The interview participants were selected based on their race and gender to have a diverse representation and could offer BIPOC population perspectives as outlined in the research question.
Study Population
All students engaged in the Indigenous science lessons during class; however, if a student did not give consent or provide assent for the study, no data was collected. The two figures below illustrate the 51 participant demographics by gender (see Figure 1) and by race/ethnicity (see Figure 2).

Participants completed the pre-lesson online survey administered by the researcher. The researcher then delivered the three lessons to all the students over the course of four weeks. Following the lessons, the participants completed a post-lesson online survey administered by the researcher. Participants received up to 20 minutes to complete the surveys on the day they were provided. Lastly, 13 total participants consented to do an optional one-on-one interview. From these participants, six were selected based on their gender and race/ethnicity in order to have a diverse representation and could offer underrepresented population perspectives as outlined in the research study. The gender demographics for the interviews were three female and three males. The race/ethnic demographics were four Hispanic/Latino (two females and two males), one Black or African American female, and one Asian male. The participants for the interview were also from underrepresented populations in STEM careers that included Black/African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and women.
Procedures for Curriculum Design
The framework for designing the unit plan consisting of three sequential science lessons implemented by the researcher was largely based on the LESMC (2020). The LESMC contains seven guiding values and principles that include:
1. Cultivate empathy, community actualization, cultural perpetuity, self-worth, self-determination, and holistic well-being of all participants, especially BIPOC. 2. Celebrate and honor Native People/s of the land and Communities of Color by providing a space to share their stories of struggle and resistance, along with their intellectual and cultural wealth.

39
3. Center and place high value on pre-colonial, ancestral, indigenous, diasporic, familial, and marginalized knowledge.
4. Critique empire, white supremacy, anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, racism, xenophobia, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society.
5. Challenge imperialist/colonial hegemonic beliefs and practices on ideological, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized levels.
6. Connect self to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice on global and local levels to ensure a truer democracy.
7. Conceptualize, imagine, and build new possibilities for post-imperial life that promote collective narratives of transformative resistance, critical hope, and radial healing.
The LESMC is based on approaches and outcomes from ethnic studies pedagogy, multicultural education, culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching, anti-racist and abolitionist teaching, decolonization, and Indigenous epistemologies. The unit plan with three sequential lessons is also aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) implemented by the researcher.
See Table 2 for the unit outline. Each lesson plan is illustrated in more detail in Appendix C, D, and E.

             Data Collection
Two instruments were used to measure students’ attitude, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers: A 21 item Likert scale survey and a one-on-one interview.
Participant Surveys
The researcher developed one Likert scale quantitative survey that measured data at two points in time, at the beginning of the study (prior to the curriculum being implemented) and at the end (at the conclusion of the unit implementation). The pre and post unit surveys were done through Qualtrics which is an online survey tool. The pre and post surveys (see Appendix F) were identical containing two basic demographic information questions for gender and one for race. It also included 21 items with four- point Likert-scale questions that measured three areas of a participant’s relationship with STEM. Seven questions measured a student’s attitude about STEM. Seven questions measured a student's participation in STEM, and seven questions measured a student’s

42
interest in STEM and STEM careers. All 21 Likert-scale survey questions were part of an attribute continuum of strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and on a scale of one to four, respectively. Each question was worded in a way that a positive impact on a participant would increase their overall score.
One-on-One Interviews
The researcher also developed six qualitative, open-ended interview questions to gain a greater understanding of the opinions of the participants at the conclusion of the unit implementation (see Table 3). These questions were only asked of participants that gave consent to be part of the study and the optional one-on-one interview. The participant interviews were conducted by the researcher via Google Meets once the unit implementation was completed. Each of the six participants was interviewed individually during class time when students were working independently or after school. Before the start of each interview, each participant was informed that their voice would be recorded and that the interview would be immediately transcribed leaving no identifiers. During the interview, students were asked two general information questions and six open-ended questions. For each interview, the open-ended questions 1 and 2 measured the student’s attitude about STEM, questions 3 and 4 measured the student’s participation in STEM, and questions 5 and 6 measured the student’s interest in STEM and STEM careers. Table 3 outlines the six open-ended questions students were asked.

Data Analysis
The quantitative data from pre and post surveys was analyzed to determine descriptive statistics for all the participants, and also broken down by gender and race/ethnicity. The surveys contained 21 Likert-scale questions that corresponded to one of three areas from the research question: attitude, participation, and interest. Pre and post survey data was first analyzed for all students, then disaggregated based on gender and race/ethnicity. A percentage analysis of the 21 Likert-scale questions was done based on strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree. As each question corresponded to one of the three areas, the responses were grouped then percentages were averaged to provide results based on area. These results for each of the three areas were compiled into a data table and compared to the post survey results. The percentage analysis of each
    
44
question was conducted to search for trends that might indicate changes between pre and post surveys.
The quantitative data was also coded and analyzed using the inferential statistics of a t-Test. The t-Test was conducted to analyze for any statistical significance between the pre and post survey results for all the participants as well as by gender and race/ethnicity. Similar to the percentage analysis performed for each of the three areas of the research study question, further t-Tests were completed for each theme within all participants, gender, and race/ethnicity. The pre survey and post survey data was analyzed using a two-tailed paired-sample t-Test since two sets of data were collected from the same participants. The researcher used a significance level of 0.05. Some of the percentage analysis results and t-Test findings will be illustrated and narrated in detail in the following chapter.
The qualitative data was collected through one-on-one interviews and responses to six open-ended questions. Six participant interviews were conducted then transcribed and analyzed for patterns or themes related to student attitude, participation, and interest. The six interview questions consisted of two questions corresponding to each of the three areas (attitude, participation, interest). Qualitative data provided participants an opportunity to further reflect and share their experience with the lessons. The data also provided the researcher the ability to triangulate the quantitative data analysis. Each participant was given a pseudonym to protect their identity.

Positionality
The researcher, Anselmo Marín, is a first-generation Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino male who has been involved with STEM dating back to constructing balsawood towers for Odyssey of the Mind competitions in the fourth grade. He participated in two middle school science fairs and enjoyed Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and AP Environmental Science in high school. As a student at Sacramento City College, he enrolled in Astronomy, Calculus, Chemistry, and Engineering courses “for fun” and earned an Associate Degree in Science. Upon completing his Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies at California State University, Sacramento (CSUS) the researcher had accumulated enough units for a concentration in Natural Sciences. It was during this time that the researcher became increasingly self-aware of his academic accomplishments and his cultural and linguistic Mexican heritage. He also noted that were little to no representation of his heritage amongst his professors or within the course curriculums.
The researcher then earned his multiple subject teaching credential from the Bilingual/Multicultural Education program at CSUS and qualified for a Science Supplemental Authorization to be added to his credential. This provided the researcher the ability to be hired as a middle school science teacher. He has been teaching middle school science for the last 13 years at a school site where students come from low-income households and are overwhelmingly Hispanic/Latino. During this time, and as a Hispanic/Latino science teacher, the researcher noticed a lack of BIPOC amongst science teachers, within the science curriculum, and in STEM careers. It led him to become a middle school Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) advisor for his
45

46
students, implement an Elementary MESA program for the kindergarten through fifth grade students at his school, and lead four consecutive school-wide annual STEM Days at his site. The lack of BIPOC in STEM also led the researcher to the Multicultural Education master’s program at Sacramento State.
In the master’s program, the researcher became increasingly aware of his position and privilege thanks in part to four Ethnic Studies courses. These courses were the first time the researcher saw his heritage positively represented in the curriculum and provided the researcher a decolonizing consciousness. This motivated the researcher to reconnect in-depth with his culture which led to his discovery of Aztec contributions in STEM and Indigenous Science. In his Ethnic Studies 203 course, the researcher learned of decolonization and a lesson plan template developed by the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (LESMC, 2020) to shift curriculum (and lessons) that was decolonial. Additionally, the researcher joined several LESMC workshops and was exposed to sample lessons using the template. While the lessons were decolonial, and some contained his heritage, there was no mention of STEM. Although the researcher is still undergoing his own decolonial process, the master’s program further developed his desire to have an impact on increasing the number of BIPOC in STEM and STEM careers through decolonized science. This study provided the researcher the opportunity to create a decolonized science unit and collect data on the impact and importance of addressing BIPOC in STEM. As an educator, the researcher’s goal continues to advocate for BIPOC in STEM and STEM careers.

The researcher is aware that his background as a Hispanic/Latino may have introduced bias or provided an advantage and access to conduct this research with the study population. While an advocate for decolonized science education, the researcher also understands that the study was conducted using traditional Westernized research methodologies. As Linda Smith argued, decolonizing methodologies must be used in order for research and science to be decolonized (Smith, 2012).

FINDINGS
This chapter reports the findings for the quantitative and qualitative data of the mixed methods study conducted by the researcher. Quantitative data was collected from 51 pre and post Likert surveys. The quantitative data for participants’ attitudes, participation, and interest in science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) was analyzed using t-Tests and percentage analysis of all the participants and broken down by gender and race/ethnicity. The t-Tests were two-tailed paired-sample t-Test with a p value of less than or equal to 0.05. They provided an opportunity for the researcher to identify any significant differences in responses between the pre and post survey. A percentage analysis of participants’ attitude, participation, and interest for all subgroups was also conducted to support findings that may or may not have been statistically significant by the t-Tests. Due to the limited number of participants, the data for the one non-binary gender student was analyzed by race/ethnicity only and the data for one Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander student was analyzed by gender only. Qualitative data was collected from six one-on-one participant interviews then analyzed for patterns and themes related to attitude, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers. The six interview participants’ pseudonyms, gender, and race/ethnicity can be found in Table 4.

Both the quantitative and qualitative data provided the researcher the ability to address the question that guided this study: How did a unit focused on decolonized science influence students’ attitudes, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers?
Attitude in STEM and STEM Careers
Questions 1-7 of the four-point Likert scale survey measured students’ attitude in STEM and STEM careers. There was a statistically significant difference (p<0.00) for the whole group of participants (n=51). The researcher conducted additional two-tailed paired-sample t-Tests based on gender and race/ethnicity to determine the influence of the

study on specific subgroups (see Table 5). The test results yielded a statistically significant p value (p<0.05) for all subgroups, except the White subgroup.

                            The t-Test for the White subgroup did not show a statistically significant difference, but the percentage analysis between the pre and post surveys showed an increase. The percentage average for attitude increased by 24%. The increase demonstrated there was some influence on the attitudes of the White subgroup. A further percentage analysis of all the subgroups can be found in Table 6.

     Difference
                         Both gender subgroups showed an increase in their percentage difference in addition to all the race/ethnicity subgroups. Except for the white subgroup, the percentage analysis supported the results of most of the t-Tests. The percentage analysis showed that participants’ attitude in STEM and STEM careers were positively influenced due to the increase in the percentages. The results of the t-Tests and the percentage analysis were further supported through responses from the one-on-one participant interviews.
The interviews contained two questions that focused on a participant’s attitude in STEM and STEM careers: 1) How did learning about Indigenous Science in STEM affect your attitude about science? and 2) How do you feel about STEM subjects? The participants’ responses reflected the subgroup quantitative data results and how their attitudes were influenced by the decolonized science unit. When responding to question 1, all participants shared a newfound favorable attitude towards STEM and STEM

52
Additionally, Ronaldo pointed out who he thought could only be scientists and how that attitude changed when learning about Indigenous Science:
When I was little and all, I always thought that only White people could be scientists, but when we were learning about Indigenous Science, it made me think in different ways.
When answering question 2, all students had an increased favorable attitude towards STEM and STEM careers. Jenny shared how she already liked STEM because it let her build, think critically, and be creative:
I really like them [STEM] because I like making things a lot and thinking hard and being creative.
Moreover, Anita enjoyed STEM due to the cultural connections she made with content:
I enjoy learning about them [STEM] and different maneras (ways) that people would use. I like learning about different plants and what they used. I did learn that my abuelito was part Indígena and all the plants they used.
Each of the participants’ statements demonstrated a positive influence and increased favorability in attitude towards STEM and STEM careers.
The quantitative and qualitative data analysis demonstrated that a positive influence did occur on most participants’ attitude in STEM and STEM careers. A statistically significant difference in the changes in attitude for the whole group (n=51) demonstrated that the decolonized science unit had a potential positive influence on the participants’ attitude in STEM and STEM careers. The three decolonized science lessons centered and placed value on Indigenous knowledge that likely revealed new information
careers. For instance, Michael discussed how his attitude about science now included connections to cultures that he did not know before:
Learning about Indigenous Science affected my learning because it opened my eyes about how much is in science and how cultures are connected to it.

to students. This new information throughout the lessons potentially influenced their attitude in STEM especially since the whole group was largely composed of two subgroups not historically represented in STEM: female (n=28) and Hispanic or Latino (n=35). There is a chance that one or two specific lessons from the unit were able to influence the attitude of the whole group.
The changes for the whole group’s attitude could have occurred due to Lesson 2, Mesoamerican (Aztec) contributions in STEM. The anecdotal interactions between the researcher and the subgroup participants revealed that they enjoyed learning about Aztec contributions in STEM. Many participants shared with the researcher that their families use specific plants from México and Central America for healing or as part of their diet. The majority of the participants were Hispanic/Latino, and the lesson could have resonated with the subgroup and contributed to the statistical significance for the whole group. The change in attitude could have also emerged from Lesson 1 where participants researched a Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) scientist of their choice. This provided participants the opportunity to establish one or several connections with their chosen BIPOC scientist. Since all but seven participants were from a BIPOC subgroup, having a possible connection with a BIPOC scientist could have contributed to the whole group’s change in attitude. Beyond the statistical significance of the whole group, there were also several subgroups that showed significant changes in attitude.
The female subgroup (n=28) and the male subgroup (n=22) showed statistically significant differences in attitude, and percentage increase for both subgroups from pre to post survey. Both subgroups could have been influenced due to the large number of
53

54
When analyzed by race/ethnicity subgroups, every subgroup except White (n=7) showed a statistical significance in attitude. Furthermore, when a percentage analysis of the survey questions was conducted by race/ethnic subgroups, it revealed a percentage increase in attitude for all BIPOC subgroups. This could have been in part due to the lessons being centered on decolonizing science through BIPOC scientists and Indigenous Science. These three decolonized science lessons could have favorably influenced all BIPOC subgroups since they and their knowledge are not typically included in the traditional curriculum. The White subgroup likely did not show a change in attitude towards STEM and STEM careers possibly because the lessons were not part of the traditional curriculum, which is steeped in Whiteness because it centers on Whites as the dominant group and Western epistemologies in science.
In the interviews, four of the six participants were Hispanic or Latino and shared connections from Lesson 2. They stated, “I knew a lot of the plants, but I didn’t know they came from the Aztecs” and “I did learn that my abuelito was part Indígena and all the plants they used.” The interviews also revealed that participants could have been positively influenced by the lessons. All six participants interviewed were BIPOC and five of them stated that their attitude about STEM and STEM careers had changed. Both females and males used words such as “it opened my eyes”; “I felt very different”; “being

55
more interested”; “it made me think in different ways.” Jenny shared that her attitude had not changed due to being interested in STEM prior to the study.
Participation in STEM and STEM Careers
Questions 8-14 of the four-point Likert scale survey measured students’ participation in STEM and STEM careers. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) for the entire group of participants (n=51). The researcher conducted additional two-tailed paired-sample t-Tests based on gender and race/ethnicity to determine any influence of the study on specific subgroups (see Table 7). The tests yielded a statistically significant p value (p<0.05) only for the female subgroup.

The increase demonstrated there was an influence on the participation of all subgroups. The analysis of all the subgroups can be found in Table 8.

                         While the female subgroup was the only one that showed a statistically significant t-Test result, the male percentage increased 7% from pre to post. All the race/ethnicity subgroups also reflected an increase in their percentage average but were not found to be statistically significant in t-Test results. The percentage analysis showed that participants’ participation in STEM and STEM careers was positively influenced due to the increase in the percentages. The results of the t-Tests and the percentage analysis were furthered through responses from the one-on-one participant interviews.
The interviews contained two questions that focused on a participant’s participation in STEM and STEM careers: 1) What do you know now from the information that was shared in Lesson 1, Lesson 2, or Lesson 3 that you did not know before? and 2) How does what you learned in Lesson 1, Lesson 2, or Lesson 3 make you feel about your role in STEM? The participants’ responses reflected some of the

57
subgroup quantitative data results and how their participation was influenced by the decolonized science unit. When responding to question 1 all participants expressed increased favorability in participation due to new learning focused on BIPOC in science and Indigenous Science. For example, Michael explained that people should be recognized in science regardless of their skin color:
That people burn fires for their culture, the Aztecs and how much medicine and plans they started using, and that people should be recognized for their science regardless of the color of their skin or what ethnicity they are.
Similarly, Bryan realized how much of the plants he already knew, but didn’t realize the medicinal uses traced back to the Aztecs:
Well, I didn’t really know about the Aztecs and what they did, including their medicines and the plants. I knew a lot of the plants, but I didn’t know they came from the Aztecs.
Each of these participant responses revealed a positive influence in participation towards STEM and STEM careers.
When answering question 2, all participants shared how they could participate in STEM after taking part in the decolonized science unit. For instance, Jenny pointed out that since BIPOC have previously done STEM then she can be in STEM too:
It makes me feel I can do more. It makes me feel I can do the science too because they [BIPOC] did it. Since they did it, I should do it so that learning science will be for the future.
Similarly, Fabiola talked about a sense of purpose and believing she can be in STEM after learning about BIPOC scientists and being part of the decolonized science unit:
It made me feel that I will be able to do anything even if people say I won’t, I can still do it. The BIPOC scientists and everything we were learning about really made me believe that I and people can really do whatever they want to do in life.

58
The qualitative data suggested that participants were positively influenced towards participating in STEM, even if most of the quantitative data analyses were not statistically significant. When analyzed for participation, the only statistically significant difference found was for the female subgroup (n=28). The female subgroup was the largest by gender and primarily composed of Hispanic or Latino participants. The intersectionality of the subgroup could have influenced their reported increase in participation in STEM and STEM careers. The possible influence on the female subgroup in the participation area could have been due to Lesson 1. When the females conducted their BIPOC scientist research, and if they selected a female scientist, it could have helped to break the gender stereotype of who is in STEM and the level of participation their female scientist had in STEM. This new information could have influenced how the female subgroup saw their own participation in STEM and STEM careers. Lesson 2 could have also influenced the females because it provided them the opportunity to see their history and culture in the curriculum. The female subgroup could have also been influenced due to the opportunity to participate more within the curriculum and the lessons themselves. The lesson activities tasked all participants with conducting research and reflecting on their learning through graphic organizers, short videos presentations, and writing.
While the only significant difference in participation was for females, the percentage analysis revealed an increase in participation for both the female and male

59
subgroups that could have been influenced by the three lessons. The interviews of the males demonstrated an increase in their participation. A few male participants stated, “It makes me feel like I can do what other scientists or others want to do in STEM” and “Well, all of these lessons made me feel like I can make some sort of contribution.” In the interviews, female participants commented “I can do the science too because they did it”; “The BIPOC scientists and everything we were learning about really made me believe that I and people can really do whatever they want to do in life.”
Interest in STEM and STEM Careers
Questions 15-21 of the four-point Likert scale survey measured students’ interest in STEM and STEM careers. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) for the entire group of participants (n=51). The researcher conducted additional two-tailed paired-sample t-Tests based on gender and race/ethnicity to determine any influence of the study on specific subgroups (see Table 9). The tests did not yield a statistically significant p value (p<0.05) for any of the subgroups.

While the t-Tests for all the subgroups did not reveal a statistical significance, the percentage analysis between the pre and post surveys showed a slight increase in most of the subgroups, except the female subgroup, who had a minor decrease. The analysis of all the subgroups can be found in Table 10.

The gender subgroups do not show a statistically significant t-Test result, but the male subgroup slightly increased in their percentage by 1%. The female subgroup decreased their percentage by 5%. All the race/ethnicity subgroups reflected small increases in their percentage average but were not found to be statistically significant in t-Test results. However, the responses from the one-on-one participant interviews illustrate that there was some positive influence on participants’ interest

The interviews contained two questions that focused on a participant’s interest in STEM and STEM careers: 1) After learning about Indigenous Science in STEM, how has your interest in a STEM field changed? and 2) What would help you become more interested in pursuing a STEM career? When responding to question 1 participants’ responses showed varying levels of interest. For example, Jenny shared that her mindset and interest in STEM had not changed, but reflected on Indigenous Science:
It hasn’t because I’ve had that certain mindset of me liking science for a while. I don’t think it will really change unless we learn something more negative than positive, but to me the Indigenous Science was positive.
Although there was no change in Jenny’s interest, she did have a positive experience with Indigenous Science. Bryan, on the other hand, explained that he became more interested in learning about Engineering:
Well, as we learned about Indigenous Science and many different types of sciences, I started looking around for more things and there’s a lot of Engineering careers. I feel like I want to learn more about them.
Most of the statements reflected participants were positively influenced in their interest of STEM or STEM careers.
As participants responded to question 2, they expressed what could be done to make pursuing a STEM career more attractive to them or others. For instance, Jenny provided several examples that could increase students’ interest in STEM:
Field trips or them [scientists] visiting us, seeing the scientist do their job, and feeling like I am a scientist.
Moreover, Ronaldo explained how a support system of individuals, or an organization might be helpful:
Having people if I am trying to do a science thing or project. If I was losing confidence, I would like people to be there and support me and believe in me.

These responses showed participants wanted to increase their own interest (and for others) in STEM and would have valued additional decolonized science lessons or interactions with STEM organizations and professionals. These opinion statements provided a picture of what could be done to help improve pursuing a STEM career that was not part of the quantitative data collected.
When analyzed for interest, there were no statistically significant differences for the whole group nor any of the subgroups. The result and lack of any influence on participants’ interest could be due to, as previously mentioned, how the three lessons centered and valued Indigenous and marginalized knowledge. Yet, there was no focus on how students could participate more in STEM or pursue STEM if they were
interested. The results could have been tied to how seriously participants took to completing their survey as they answered more questions. The first set of seven survey questions measured a participants’ attitude about STEM. Seven questions then measured a participants’ participation in STEM, and finally, seven questions measured a participants’ interest in STEM and STEM careers. The surveys were voluntary, and it is not uncommon for middle school students to forget instructions or to submit an incomplete task.
While no gender or race/ethnic subgroup showed a change in interest, the percentage analysis and interviews indicated that there was an interest in STEM, particularly for the Hispanic/Latino and White subgroups. The lessons were new information for all students but could have resonated more with the Hispanic or Latino
62

63
subgroup. The White subgroup could have increased their interest due to the new information from the lessons. No White participants were interviewed, but Hispanic or Latino participants stated, “when we learned about the Aztecs, it made me very intrigued that they can make, that they can pull everything off”; “I feel like I want to learn more about it [STEM] in general”; “It [the lessons] makes me want to go into Technology and Engineering.” In order to increase their interest in STEM and STEM careers, some participants advised “Maybe like feeling like I am a scientist” and “If there was more articles we could read on our own time. I know you did provide articles, but possibly more articles on different subjects in the BIPOC and Indigenous Science.” If the researcher had included these aspects in the study perhaps there would have been a statistical significance for interest with other subgroups or the entire group.
Conclusion
The researcher created a survey to evaluate the influence a decolonized science unit may have had on students’ attitudes, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers. The survey collected quantitative data from pre and post surveys that the researcher analyzed through t-Tests and percentage analysis to determine any possible influence on participants. Qualitative data was collected from six participants and was used to identify themes related to participants’ attitude, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers. The data analysis revealed some positive influence on participants. The next chapter will have a further discussion of how these findings connect to the literature.

DISCUSSION, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND CONCLUSION
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to determine how a decolonized science unit that incorporated Indigenous science influences Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) students’ attitude, participation, and interest in science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) and STEM careers. The components considered in this research were quantitative data from pre and post survey results, and qualitative data from one-on- one interviews. The research question guiding this study was: How did a unit focused on decolonized science influence BIPOC students’ attitude, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers? The findings suggest that participants were positively influenced in attitude, participation, and interest. The quantitative and qualitative data analysis demonstrated that a positive influence did occur on most participants’ attitude in STEM and STEM careers. The qualitative data suggested that participants were positively influenced towards participating in STEM. The qualitative data suggested that a positive influence did occur on most participants' interest in STEM. These findings further support the discussion in Chapter 2 regarding decolonized science and Indigenous science with students.
Brayboy and Castagno (2008) concluded that decolonized science resulted in students with “enhanced increased self-esteem, develop healthy [cultural identities] ... and engagement” (p. 733). Participants’ survey results and their one-on-one interviews demonstrated their attitude was positively influenced by the decolonized science unit.
64

65
During the interviews, participants reflected on the unit using words such as “proud” and “surprised.” Research from Jegede and Okebukola (1991) and Lubben and Campbell (1996) revealed that student interest and achievement increased whenever African communities collaborated with science educators and created cross cultural school science (decolonized science). Participants shared during their interviews that their interest was positively influenced towards STEM and STEM careers. Lastly, Richards, Hove, and Afolabi (2008) discussed that students’ achievement increased when Indigenous content was incorporated into the curriculum. Participants showed a positive influence in attitude, participation, and interest towards STEM when Indigenous science was part of their curriculum. The results of this study further support the theorization of decolonized science and Indigenous science. Universities, curriculum developers, Departments of Education, and schools need to support these concepts because there is a value that comes from these theories.
Further Research
After this study, the following research can be conducted to advance this study and its findings. In conversation with other researchers advocating for decolonized science and Indigenous science, a decolonized science unit was developed and proved influential for BIPOC students. More research is needed on the level of influence decolonized science and Indigenous science can have on students. Additionally, although this study advocated for decolonized science, it was conducted using traditional Westernized research methods. More research is needed with the implementation of decolonial thinking and decolonial research methods outlined by Smith (2012).
       
66
This study also presents an opportunity for other researchers to build upon and contribute to education. It would be interesting for this study to be conducted where there is not a majority minority population. The researcher did not interview any White students as part of the study and the subgroup did not have a significant increase in attitude. The lack of increase could be due to White students being part of the dominant group and already being highly represented in STEM and STEM careers. Further research could provide a clearer perspective on how White students are or are not influenced by this study.
Additionally, the study could be modified for lessons on decolonized technology, engineering, or mathematics. A cross-curricular approach could be conducted in an elementary K-5 classroom or for a single subject STEM course in the secondary grades. Mathematics is another subject where BIPOC populations are underrepresented, can feel unsuccessful, or believe they are “not good at math.” Another study could also keep the same focus on Indigenous Science but center on science from African or Asian cultures rather than Mesoamerica.
Furthermore, the study could be modified to measure how decolonized science and Indigenous Science influence the social and emotional levels of BIPOC students. When the researcher interviewed participants, the words “proud”; “confidence”; “intrigued”; and “surprised” were stated to how they saw their role in STEM after the three lesson unit. The use of decolonized science and Indigenous Science could be a way to promote the mental health of BIPOC students using antiracist science education.

Further research is needed to determine how influential decolonized science and Indigenous Science are on BIPOC students.
Limitations of the Findings
After completing the study, the researcher noted several limitations that could have further influenced the participants’ attitudes, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers. The researcher designed and implemented a unit plan consisting of three sequential science lessons based on the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (LESMC, 2020). While the researcher was familiar with the LESMC, the unit plan was not vetted by the LESMC group. This could have led to the lessons not being developed or implemented as intended by the LESMC. These lessons were also aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS, 2013) yet they could have used a stronger science integration. A stronger science integration could have included hands-on lesson activities for participants and an explicit focus on the Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), and Cross-Cutting Concepts (CCCs). One of the challenges to make these lessons more hands-on was the format in which these lessons were presented.
The study and three sequential science lessons were all done virtually via the Google Suite due to COVID-19 restrictions. The virtual format may have contributed to the lessons not having as much influence on participants as in-person instruction may have. In-person instruction would have provided the researcher a greater ability to check for understanding and ensure participants were on task, rather than attempting to do so in an online environment. The format may have also influenced the number of students

willing to give ascent or receive consent from their families. While the researcher provided multiple recruiting methods and information about the study was translated into Spanish, there were many students and families that did not reply to the forms and letters.
Other limitations of the study include the population size and its impact on the study’s findings. First, there were low numbers of Asian, Black or African American, and White subgroup participants. The contributing factor to these low numbers was the population that the researcher could draw upon for the study. If this study had been conducted in person more participants from these subgroups may have joined. Secondly, the low population numbers created a small sample size and made the findings of the study not generalizable or representative of specific subgroups. However, the data and findings can be used to generate themes and hypotheses for future research.
Lastly, the researcher could have focused on Indigenous Science from other cultures outside Mesoamerican (Aztec) cultures and California Native Tribes. A focus on Indigenous Science and contributions to STEM from Asian and African cultures could have resonated more with participants from those specific races/ethnicities.
Policy Implications
Given the findings and limitations from this study, several recommendations are encouraged to enhance the research related to decolonized science education and BIPOC entering STEM and STEM careers. The participants in this study were middle school students with no previous exposure to decolonized science or Indigenous Science content. This lack of exposure was evident in the quantitative responses by participants and could have influenced their reactions to a decolonized science curriculum. An elementary,

69
middle school, or complete Kindergarten through 12th grade pipeline of Indigenous Science and decolonized science could greatly benefit students. The topic of plants and their medicinal use was briefly discussed in Lesson 2 of the decolonized science unit; however, this could be a unit for a grade level or theme throughout the entire pipeline. An essential question for the unit or theme could be: What does your family do when you don’t feel well? Furthermore, a fourth lesson focused on plants and medicinal uses could be added to the three-lesson sequence developed by the researcher.
As discussed in Chapter 2, teachers create curriculum and provide instruction based on what they know and have been taught (Picower, 2021). Their ideas about who scientists are and what counts as science can be influenced by K-12 education and could be reinforced in college-level courses, including teacher preparatory programs. Decolonized science along with cultural practices, such as Shamanism, that are dismissed as science are needed in science methods courses. This type of science and cultural practices could better prepare pre-service teachers, who are entering classrooms with primarily BIPOC students, to incorporate this into their instruction and have a greater cultural understanding of the populations they serve.
Curriculum developers should reconsider the science curriculum they design for teachers and classrooms. As mentioned in Chapter 2, science curriculums are based on the NGSS which centers Eurocentric knowledge and whitewashes the curriculum. The use of decolonized science is needed for students to live in harmony with nature rather than to dominate it. Decolonized science curriculum would also be more representative of BIPOC students in classrooms and positively influence them in STEM and STEM

70
The study revealed that the decolonized science lessons influenced students’ attitudes, participation, and interest in STEM and STEM careers. Overall female and BIPOC students seemed to react favorably to decolonized science. Decolonized science must be a larger part of science education to nurture BIPOC in STEM and help bring an end to systemic and environmental racism or injustice. As Tuck and Yang (2012) reminded us through their work, decolonization is not a metaphor.
careers. The Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (LESMC) would be a great resource for curriculum developers to create a decolonized science curriculum.
